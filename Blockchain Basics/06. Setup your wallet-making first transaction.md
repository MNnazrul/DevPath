### Transaction Details

Taking a brief look at some of the details of our transaction on Etherscan, we're given a lot of insight. Understanding these properties is a fundamental part of being a blockchain developer. Some of the basic details include:

* Transaction Hash - This is a unique identifier for our transaction
* From - The originating address of the transaction request
* To - The address a transaction was sent to
* Value - Any funds included with the transaction
* Gas - The cost of the transaction to execute, we'll be looking into gas more closely in the next lesson.
