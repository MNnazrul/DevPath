# 🔹 Understanding makemigrations vs migrate in Django

Django uses migrations to track database schema changes. You must run both `makemigrations` and `migrate` at different stages to apply model changes.

---

## ✅ 1. When to Run makemigrations?

`python manage.py makemigrations` generates migration files based on your model changes.

### Run makemigrations When:

- You create a new model
- You modify an existing model (add, remove, or change fields)
- You delete a model

---

## ✅ 2. When to Run migrate?

`python manage.py migrate` applies migration files to the database.

### Run migrate When:

- You ran `makemigrations` and want to apply the changes to the database
- You cloned a project and need to apply migrations
- You switched to a new database (e.g., SQLite to MySQL)
- You reset your database and need to recreate tables

### Example

After running `makemigrations`, apply the migrations:

`python manage.py migrate`

Django will apply all pending migrations and update the database.

---

## ✅ 3. Example Workflow

1️⃣ Make changes to `models.py`  
2️⃣ Run `makemigrations` to generate migrations

- `python manage.py makemigrations`  
  3️⃣ Run `migrate` to apply changes to the database
- `python manage.py migrate`

---

## ✅ 4. Checking Migration Status

To see if there are pending migrations, run:

```
python manage.py showmigrations`
```

If migrations are pending ( `[ ]` ), run `migrate` to apply them.
