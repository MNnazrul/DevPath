📌 Important Hooks in Next.js
Next.js is built on top of React, so it supports both React Hooks and Next.js-specific Hooks. Below is a categorized list of all important hooks used in Next.js development.

1️⃣ React Core Hooks (Works in Next.js)
These are standard React hooks that are commonly used in Next.js projects.

Hook	Purpose
useState	Manages local component state
useEffect	Handles side effects like API calls, event listeners
useContext	Shares global state without prop drilling
useRef	Accesses DOM elements and stores mutable values without re-renders
useReducer	Manages complex state logic, an alternative to useState
useMemo	Optimizes expensive calculations by memoizing values
useCallback	Optimizes function references to prevent unnecessary re-renders
useLayoutEffect	Similar to useEffect, but runs synchronously after DOM mutations
useImperativeHandle	Customizes the instance value exposed by useRef
✅ Best for: General state management, performance optimization, and component lifecycle handling.

2️⃣ Next.js-Specific Hooks
Next.js provides custom hooks to handle routing, data fetching, and other Next.js features.

Hook	Purpose
useRouter	Accesses Next.js router for navigation and query params
useSearchParams	Retrieves URL search parameters (Next.js App Router)
usePathname	Gets the current URL pathname (Next.js App Router)
useParams	Retrieves dynamic route parameters (App Router)
useSelectedLayoutSegments	Gets selected segments in layouts (App Router)
useSWR	Fetches, caches, and revalidates data (recommended for client-side data fetching)
✅ Best for: Routing, query params, client-side data fetching.

3️⃣ State Management Hooks in Next.js
For global state management, Next.js supports React hooks along with external libraries like Zustand, Redux, or Jotai.

Hook	Purpose
useContext	Simple global state management (without Redux)
useReducer	Manages complex state logic (built-in alternative to Redux)
useStore (Zustand)	Lightweight state management with React hooks
useSelector / useDispatch (Redux)	Manages global state using Redux Toolkit
✅ Best for: Managing state globally without prop drilling.

4️⃣ Data Fetching Hooks
Next.js supports both server-side and client-side data fetching.

Client-Side Data Fetching Hooks
Hook	Purpose
useSWR	Fetches and caches API data with automatic revalidation
useEffect + fetch	Basic way to fetch data inside components
Server-Side Data Fetching (without hooks)
Function	Purpose
getServerSideProps	Fetches data on each request (SSR)
getStaticProps	Fetches data at build time (SSG)
getStaticPaths	Defines dynamic routes with getStaticProps
✅ Best for: Handling API data in Next.js.

5️⃣ Form & Input Handling Hooks
Hook	Purpose
useForm (React Hook Form)	Manages form state efficiently
useState	Manages form input states manually
useRef	Accesses form fields without re-renders
✅ Best for: Handling forms with validation.

6️⃣ Authentication Hooks
If using NextAuth.js, these hooks handle authentication in Next.js.

Hook	Purpose
useSession	Retrieves user session (for authentication)
useUser (Clerk/Auth0)	Gets user details from third-party auth providers
✅ Best for: User authentication and sessions.

🔥 Summary: Most Important Hooks for Next.js Development
🚀 Must-Know React Hooks
✅ useState → Local state management
✅ useEffect → Side effects (API calls, event listeners)
✅ useContext → Global state (small apps)
✅ useRef → DOM manipulation & persistent values
🔥 Next.js-Specific Hooks
✅ useRouter → Navigation & query parameters
✅ useSearchParams → URL search params (App Router)
✅ usePathname → Get the current URL pathname
✅ useSWR → Client-side data fetching
🛠️ Advanced Hooks
✅ useReducer → Complex state management
✅ useMemo / useCallback → Performance optimizations
